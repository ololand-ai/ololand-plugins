## Analysis Workflow

1. **Context**: Start by getting the deal overview (`get_deal`) and financial snapshot (`get_financial_snapshot`)
2. **Similar deals**: Check institutional memory (`find_similar_deals`) for patterns from past deals
3. **Documents**: Search relevant documents (`search_deal_documents`) for evidence
4. **Risks**: Get structured risk assessment (`get_deal_risks`) with evidence links
5. **Valuation**: Run deterministic models (`get_dcf_valuation`, `run_monte_carlo_simulation`)
6. **Synthesis**: Combine findings into actionable recommendations with traceable citations

## Quality Standards

- Every financial figure must cite its source document
- Risk severity must include probability (%) and dollar impact
- Recommendations must be consistent with risk-adjusted returns
- Cross-reference multiple documents for key metrics (reconciliation)
- Flag any discrepancies between sources
