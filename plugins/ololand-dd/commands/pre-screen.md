description: Run a pre-NDA public-company screen — create the deal, ingest filings only (no web search, no news, no merger filings), extract risks, run Monte Carlo, and produce a 1-page pre-screen brief. Designed for "is this public target worth pursuing before we spend diligence dollars?"

# Pre-Announcement Public Screen

Run an end-to-end **stage-1** screening of a public company using only its public filings. No NDA, no management projections, no deal-side materials, no current news — by design.

This is the pre-NDA counterpart to `/ic-memo-skeptical`. Where that command refreshes against the latest public 8-K so a stored deal record can't drift stale, `/pre-screen` does the opposite: it deliberately constrains the evidence set to pre-cutoff filings so the output reflects what a sponsor would have seen *before* any transaction was announced. Use it when David's point applies — "would OloLand have told me to pursue this if I'd never heard of the deal?"

## Usage

```
/pre-screen <ticker or company name> [as-of YYYY-MM-DD]
```

## Arguments

- `<ticker or company name>` (required) — Free text. Examples: `GBTG`, `Amex GBT`, `SNOW`, `Snowflake`.
- `as-of <YYYY-MM-DD>` (optional) — Cutoff date. The screen will deliberately ignore any filing, news, or evidence dated after this. If omitted, defaults to today. Provide this whenever you're running a retrospective screen against a public target whose deal has already been announced.

## Why this command exists

`run_due_diligence` and `generate_investment_memo` both fan out to web search by default. That makes them useful for *announced* deals where the announcement IS the most important fact, and useless for *pre-screen* exercises where the announcement is the answer key you're not allowed to peek at.

The Project Atlas / GBTG screen attempt (2026-05-12, `deal554a83ba4a12` for pre-announcement / `deal4fdd2334a0bd` for post-announcement comparison) surfaced the gap:

- `run_due_diligence` populated 134 risks but did not fan out to DCF / LBO / summary tiles
- The post-announcement deal's precedent-transactions tile included the deal being screened as its own comp — direct contamination
- The Forensic Screen SKU correctly refused to run on public-only data, but no single command set up the user to expect this

`/pre-screen` enforces the orchestration that produces a clean stage-1 artifact. It assembles from explicit tile reads with web search explicitly off, frames the Monte Carlo P5↔P95 spread as the value-add (not as an appendix caveat), and tells the user where the public screen stops being enough so they go into stage-2 with the right expectations.

## Orchestration (every step is required; do not skip)

Execute in order. Surface gaps as diligence asks rather than papering over them.

### Step 1 — Resolve the company

1. Call `resolve_company` with the user's query. For clean tickers (`GBTG`, `MSFT`, `BRK.B`) pass `hint="public"`.
2. If multiple candidates come back above 0.7 confidence, list the top 3-5 and ask which one. Don't guess.
3. Capture the picked ticker + CIK + classification.

If the resolver returns `classification != "public"`, halt and tell the user: this command only handles public targets. Private-target pre-screening is a different workflow (no SEC filings, no FMP snapshot, no point pretending we have an audit trail we don't).

### Step 2 — Create the deal

Call `create_deal` with:

- `query` — the user's original text
- `ticker_override` — from step 1
- `cik_override` — from step 1
- `hint` — `"public"`
- `deal_mode` — `"screening"` (this is a screen, not a formal DD setup)

Watch ingestion with `check_task_status` until `state == "SUCCESS"`. Public-filer ingestion typically completes in 15-30s. Capture the resulting `deal_id`.

### Step 3 — Confirm the document set is pre-cutoff and pristine

Call `list_deal_documents(deal_id)`. Expected output: exactly the 10-K from EDGAR plus the FMP financial snapshot. Nothing else.

If you see ANY additional uploaded PDFs (proxy statements, merger communications, 8-K announcement decks, transaction press releases, news articles), halt and tell the user: this deal was pre-seeded with announcement-era materials and is not a clean pre-screen target. Recommend creating a fresh deal via `/new-deal` and trying again on the new ID.

If `as-of` was provided, also verify the 10-K's `filing_date` is before the cutoff. If the most recent available 10-K post-dates the cutoff, walk back to the prior fiscal year's 10-K (the resolver and `create_deal` don't yet support `as-of` natively — surface this as a known limitation and pause for the user's instruction).

### Step 4 — Read the financial spine from explicit tiles

This is a **web-off** run. The whole point of `/pre-screen` is that the artifact reflects only what was knowable from pre-cutoff filings — any tool that reaches the live internet (announcements, current news, sell-side commentary, press releases) silently leaks the answer key into the screen.

**Deny-list — do NOT call any of these during `/pre-screen`:**

- `run_due_diligence` — fans out internally to `deep_research`, which fires web search.
- `deep_market_research` / `research_market` — both invoke Google Search agents.
- `fetch_public_deal_facts` — designed for memo *refresh* (8-K + press-release fetch); ingests live web data by design.
- `generate_investment_memo` (legacy / deprecated) — routes through `deep_research` for the executive summary.
- `WebFetch`, `WebSearch` — Claude built-ins; one call breaks the cutoff guarantee.
- `tavily_*` (any Tavily MCP tool — `tavily_search`, `tavily_crawl`, `tavily_extract`, `tavily_map`, `tavily_research`).
- `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` (any browser-automation tool — `navigate`, `read_page`, `get_page_text`, etc.).
- Any other MCP tool whose description says "search the web," "browse," "fetch URL," or "look up current news."

If you find yourself reaching for any of these, stop. The information you want is either already in the ingested 10-K (re-read it via `search_deal_documents`) or it's a stage-2 question that doesn't belong in this brief.

**Use these instead** (filing-only, deterministic):

- `get_financial_snapshot(deal_id)` — base revenue, EBITDA, net debt, cash, CapEx, growth, margins. Source: FMP snapshot. Inspect the `as_of` date in the response and note in the brief.
- `get_deal_risks(deal_id, limit=150)` — pulls the auto-extraction risks from the 10-K ingestion (typically 100-140 for a public target). Every `source_excerpt` should reference the 10-K filename. If any risk's `file_name` is NOT the 10-K, that's a contamination signal — surface it as a `[gap]` and exclude that risk from the brief.
- `search_deal_documents(deal_id, query)` — when you need a quote or a specific number, retrieve from the ingested 10-K rather than recalling from training data.

### Step 5 — Run Monte Carlo

Call `run_monte_carlo_simulation(deal_id, n_simulations=10000, seed=42)`. The fixed seed makes the run reproducible across demos.

In the brief, report:

- Mean / Median EV ($M)
- P5 / P25 / P75 / P95 EV ($M)
- VaR(5%) and CVaR(5%)
- Mean / Median equity value ($M)
- `assumption_provenance` breakdown — which parameters were sourced (revenue, growth, margin, capex, net debt) and which defaulted (typically WACC + terminal growth pre-NDA, because we don't have a comps set yet)
- `assumption_coverage` (target: ≥0.6 for the brief to carry weight)

UNLIKE `/ic-memo-skeptical`, the MC numerics belong in the BODY of this brief, not the appendix. Pre-NDA, the MC distribution **is** the value-add — it makes the cost of pre-NDA uncertainty explicit and lets the sponsor see whether the P95 upside even reaches the rumored or announced price. Caveat the defaulted assumptions inline; don't suppress the numbers.

### Step 6 — Pull the deal indicators tile

Call `get_deal_indicators(deal_id)` and `render_risk_matrix_tile(deal_id)`. These give the categorical risk distribution and deal health score without invoking the heavyweight summary-tile pipeline (which depends on web research).

Report:

- Total risks by severity (high / medium / low)
- Top 3-5 risk categories by count
- 246-taxonomy concentration (where the risks cluster — is this a "Liquidity + Synergies" target, a "Channel Concentration + Privacy" target, etc.)

### Step 7 — Skip Forensic Screen explicitly

Do NOT call `generate_forensic_screen_pdf`. It pre-flights for `financial_snapshot + audit_or_tax_return + management_projections` and will correctly refuse on public-only data. Tell the user this in one sentence:

> The Pre-LOI Forensic Screen (Beneish, Benford, EBITDA bridge, journal-entry testing, lapping detection) is a stage-2 product. It requires management-supplied transaction-level data and runs once the NDA is signed. Pre-NDA, the closest signal is the Revenue Quality risk class flagged from the 10-K — surface that in step 4's risk readout if present.

This isn't a gap; it's the platform design. Framing it as a product clarification is what separates this command from a hacky pre-screen attempt.

### Step 8 — Compose the pre-screen brief

Output a single-page artifact in this exact shape (don't deviate; this layout is what makes the comparison to `/ic-memo-skeptical` legible):

```
# Pre-Announcement Public Screen — {Company Name} ({Ticker})

**As-of:** {cutoff date or "today"}
**Sources:** 10-K dated {filing_date} (period: {period_of_report}) + FMP financial snapshot. No web search, no news, no transaction filings.
**Deal ID:** {deal_id}
**Run:** {ISO timestamp}

## Headline

{One sentence stating the Monte Carlo finding in terms the user asked about. Example: "10,000-scenario Monte Carlo P95 enterprise value: $2.41B. Any deal price above that level depends on assumptions outside what public filings support."}

## Financial spine

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Revenue (LTM) | $X.XB | FMP / 10-K |
| EBITDA (LTM) | $XM | FMP / 10-K |
| EBITDA margin | X.X% | derived |
| Net debt | $X.XB | balance sheet |
| Revenue growth (5yr CAGR) | X.X% | historical |
| CapEx % revenue | X.X% | FMP |

## Monte Carlo valuation (10,000 simulations)

| Percentile | Enterprise Value | Equity Value |
|---|---|---|
| P5 | $XXX M | $XX M |
| P25 | $XXX M | $XX M |
| Median | $X.XB | $XX M |
| Mean | $X.XB | $XXX M |
| P75 | $X.XB | $XXX M |
| P95 | $X.XB | $XXX M |

VaR(5%): $XXX M | CVaR(5%): $XXX M | Assumption coverage: XX% (sourced) / XX% (defaulted)

Defaulted assumptions (pre-NDA, no comps set): {list, e.g. "WACC, terminal growth"}. These widen the distribution and are the value-add to compress in stage 2.

## Risk concentration (134 categorized risks from 10-K only)

| Severity | Count |
|---|---|
| High | X |
| Medium | XX |
| Low | XX |

Top 5 risk clusters (by count + materiality):

1. **{Category}** — {one-line summary, sourced from the highest-severity risk in the cluster}. _Source: 10-K, page/section reference._
2. ...

## Where the public screen stops

The following diligence work requires the NDA + data room:

- Forensic QoE (Beneish, Benford, EBITDA bridge, journal-entry testing, lapping detection) — needs management transaction-level data
- Customer concentration top-20 list — 10-K only discloses ">10% of revenue" aggregates
- Covenant cascade modeling under stress — needs full credit agreement, not summary
- Management projections vs. consensus reconciliation — projections aren't public
- Real revenue quality test — needs multi-period transaction data

Each of these maps to a stage-2 workflow. The fact that they aren't here is design, not omission.

## Recommendation

Exactly one of:
- **Pass:** {one-sentence reason — typically "P95 EV below any plausible deal price" or "risk concentration in deal-killer categories"}
- **Pursue to NDA:** {one-sentence reason — typically "P95 EV competitive with reference pricing AND risk clusters look diligence-able"}
- **More public data needed:** {one-sentence reason — typically "assumption coverage below 0.6, surface ambiguity before committing to next step"}

## Stage-2 entry point

If the recommendation is "Pursue to NDA," the user's next commands after the NDA closes are:

1. **`/ic-memo-skeptical {deal_id}`** — defensive memo composition with the Project Atlas hardening (pre-render reconciliation, source-hierarchy citations, gating conditions, freshness gate). This is the primary recommended path.
2. **`/forensic-screen {deal_id}`** — once management financials are uploaded (audited or tax + management projections), runs the seven-primitive forensic battery (Beneish, Benford, EBITDA bridge, journal-entry testing, lapping detection, working-capital, revenue quality).

> _Legacy:_ `/dd-analyze {deal_id}` predates the Project Atlas hardening and routes through the un-gated legacy memo path (no pre-render reconciliation enforcement, no constrained recommendation enum, war-game auto-included). **Do not recommend it** for new stage-2 work — use `/ic-memo-skeptical` instead. Kept available only for back-compat with existing tile pipelines.

```

### Step 9 — Hand off

After presenting the brief, output a short pre-screen audit log:

- **Source set verified:** list of documents in the data room (should be exactly the 10-K + FMP snapshot)
- **Contamination check:** number of risks whose `file_name` was NOT the 10-K (target: 0)
- **MC assumption coverage:** sourced / defaulted breakdown
- **Forensic Screen:** correctly refused (insufficient_inputs) — confirmed stage-2 boundary
- **Cutoff respected:** as-of date used + filing dates verified

The audit log is what differentiates this command from "an LLM read a 10-K and made up some numbers." Always surface it.

## URL Conventions (STRICT)

- Domain is `app.ololand.ai`. Not `.com`. Not any other TLD.
- Deal summary: `https://app.ololand.ai/deals/{deal_id}/summary`
- Risks view: `https://app.ololand.ai/deals/{deal_id}/risks`
- Valuations: `https://app.ololand.ai/deals/{deal_id}/valuations`
- Data room: `https://app.ololand.ai/deals/{deal_id}/dataroom`

When a tool response includes a `view_url`, render verbatim — never construct a URL the tool didn't return.
